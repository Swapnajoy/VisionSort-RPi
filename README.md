## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Hailo AI Environment Setup

This project utilizes **Hailo’s AI acceleration platform** for deploying YOLOv8 models on the Raspberry Pi 5.  
You can find the environment setup in their [official repo](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples).

#### 🛠️ Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples.git
cd hailo-rpi5-examples
./install.sh
```

Every time you open a new terminal session, activate the environment:

```bash
source setup_env.sh
```

### 🚀 Running the Conveyor Sorting System

Run the real-time detection and sorting application using:

```bash
python detection/detection.py \
  --labels-json resources/nut_bolt-labels.json \
  --hef-path model/nut_bolt_model.hef \
  --input rpi
```

> Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the system gracefully.

## 🧠 Training the YOLOv8 Model

The model used in this project is a **fine-tuned YOLOv8n** trained on a **custom Roboflow dataset** (9000+ images).

📜 Training script used: [`training.py`](training.py)

- Based on YOLOv8n.pt pretrained weights
- Trained to detect only two classes: `bolt` and `nut`
- Handled augmentation, batch balancing, and early stopping

---

## 🔄 Model Conversion for Hailo Deployment

YOLOv8 `.pt` model was converted to Hailo-compatible `.hef` format using the **Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC)**.

📓 Conversion steps are documented in [`Convert_YoloV8_to_HEF.ipynb`](Convert_YoloV8_to_HEF.ipynb)

### 🔁 Pipeline
- `.pt` → `.onnx` via Ultralytics export
- `.onnx` → `.hef` using Hailo’s `hef-generator` script

📚 Guide followed: [Guide to Using Hailo DFC](https://community.hailo.ai/t/guide-to-using-the-dfc-to-convert-a-modified-yolov11-on-google-colab/7131)
